                I am learning enthusiast Full Stack Developer with 8+ years
                of experience in web development.

                I had started my career as a professional Web Developer
                after I moved to Brno (Czech Republic) and did not finish
                my Master's degree in Software Engineering (I got cca 2/3
                ECTS credits). I started working in 2014 as Junior Web
                Developer in small Agency located in Brno. During my work
                for this agency I fall in love with developing websites.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-3'>
                Throughout my work years in Brno I changed jobs so I have a
                lot of experience with developing web applications from
                front-end perspective and also from back-end perspective. I
                mastered most of the technology and procedures necessary
                for web development.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-3'>
                After few years I decide that I want to be Full Stack
                developer.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-3'>
                In 2019 I started studying at Tomas Bata University in Zl√≠n
                (Czech Republic). After first semester I interrupted my
                study and moved to London where I work as Web Developer for
                CSL Website group. I stayed in London for one year and then
                I moved back to Czech Republic because I want to finish my
                Masters degree. I managed to balance my study and work and
                finally, in 2022 I got my Master's degree in Information
                Technology (Specialization Software Engineering).

                I am always looking for opportunities where I can use and
                further develop my knowledge of JavaScript, React, TDD,
                Clean code and functional programming.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-3'>
                My plans for the future are to complete WAS (Web
                Accessibility Specialist) certification and learn German
                and Japanese.
